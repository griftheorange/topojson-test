# TopoGlobe - README

## Concept

The main purpose of this project was a proof-of-concept piece meant to practice implementation of D3 features/functions in a React setting. D3 typically works by directly adding and appending to elements on the DOM, and I wanted to test out ways to adapt it's functions to React's component-state environment for use in follow-up projects.

The results were a relatively simple collection of code, but I've found it to be a useful reference in follow-up projects for the challenges that come with merging vanilla JS libraries with React and common ways to resolve these conflicts.

## Settup

First clone the library with the following line of code: 


git clone git@github.com:griftheorange/topojson-test.git


Once the file is cloned, cd into the directory then run: 
- npm install
- npm start
This will boot up a development server of the application. Alternatively, you can run "yarn build" to compile a build version, then run serve -s build. This can take a minute or two to compile the build and is not necessary for a project this size.

# Default Provided Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
